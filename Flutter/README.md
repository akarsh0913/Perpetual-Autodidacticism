# Flutter

### Programming Fundamentals

- Variables allow to store different types of information.
  ```
    String name = "Sebastian";
    int age = 21;
    double pi = 3.14159;
    bool isBeginner = true;
  ```

- BASIC MATH OPERATORS
  ```
    4 + 4 = 8, add
    5 - 3 = 2, subtract
    2 * 3 = 6, multiply
    9 / 3 = 3, divide
    9 % 4 = 1, remainder
    ++, increment by one
    --, decrement by one
  ```

- COMPARISON OPERATORS
  ```
    5 == 5 -> true,   EQUAL TO
    2 != 3 -> true,   NOT EQUAL TO
    3 > 2  -> true,   GREATER THAN
    3 < 2  -> false,  LESS THAN
    5 >= 5 -> true,   GREATER OR EQUAL TO
    3 <= 7 -> true,   LESS OR EQUAL TO 
  ```

- LOGICAL OPERATORS
    - AND operator, returns true if both sides are true
      ```
        isBeginner && ( age < 18 ) -> returns false
      ```
    - OR operator, returns true if at least one side is true
      ```
        isBeginner || ( age < 18 ) -> returns true
      ```
    - NOT operator, returns the opposite value
      ```
        !isBeginner -> returns false
      ```


Everything is a Widget (everything in flutter is a widget)
Navigation (how to navigate to different screens)
Stateless vs Stateful Widgets
User Input
To Do App (Saving data in phone's local storage)
E-commerce App (Neccessary functionalities like adding items to the cart)
